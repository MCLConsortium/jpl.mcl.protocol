Installation
============

Use Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.

• Add ``eke.study`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        edrn.summarizer
    
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout
    
You don't need a ZCML slug because it uses z3c.autoinclude.plugin with the
Plone target.
        
• Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
  
    % ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
